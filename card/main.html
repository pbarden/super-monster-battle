                <em>What you'll need:</em>
            </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Game board
                </li>
                <li>
                    Set of dice
                </li>
                <li>
                    Player tokens
                </li>
                <li>
                    2-6 Players
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                When you set up the game board, each player may place their token on any open start space. Players take turns rolling dice to determine their play order - the player with the highest roll is Player 1, followed by the next highest as Player 2, and so on.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each player starts with 5 gold and gets a bonus 1 gold at the beginning of each turn. On a player's first turn, that player draws 3 monster cards and chooses any common card among them to be added to that player's team.
            </p>
            <p>
                Players take turns rolling the dice and moving around the board, following instructions for each space as a player may land on them. Each player will collect achievements along the way, later used to determine the winner of the game.
